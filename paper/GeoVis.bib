  abstract = {The emergence of huge taxonomies due to the increase in available data raises numerous problems of visualization and navigation through the corresponding hierarchies. On datasets of such scale, classical graph drawing methods do not take advantage of some human cognitive skills such as shape recognition, which easily remember the global structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a method based on a geographic map metaphor. By employing human perception mechanisms developed by handling geographic maps, this technique facilitates the visualization and navigation through a hierarchy. The algorithm has been designed to preserve regions containment according to the arborescent hierarchy and to set the leaves' sizes proportionally to a property, in such way the size of non-leaf regions correspond to the sum of the sizes of their children. Moreover, the input ordering of the hierarchy's nodes is preserved, i.e. the areas representing two consecutive children of a node in the hierarchy are adjacent. This property is particularly useful as it guarantees some stability to our algorithm. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations of the repartition of the tax money in the U.S. over time. Furthermore, we validated the use of the geographical metaphor in a professional documentation context. We show the stability and the ease of memorisation of this type of map.},

  abstract = {Cartograms visualize quantitative data about a set of regions such as countries or states. There are several different types of cartograms and \textendash{} for some \textendash{} algorithms to automatically construct them exist. We focus on mosaic cartograms: cartograms that use multiples of simple tiles \textendash{} usually squares or hexagons \textendash{} to represent regions. Mosaic cartograms communicate well data that consist of, or can be cast into, small integer units (for example, electorial college votes). In addition, they allow users to accurately compare regions and can often maintain a (schematized) version of the input regions' shapes. We propose the first fully automated method to construct mosaic cartograms. To do so, we first introduce mosaic drawings of triangulated planar graphs. We then show how to modify mosaic drawings into mosaic cartograms with low cartographic error while maintaining correct adjacencies between regions. We validate our approach experimentally and compare to other cartogram methods.},

Towards fighting the COVID-19 outbreak, countries worldwide and international organisations have taken various actions, including promoting the transparency of and public access to disease data. In such public communications, maps have played an important role in that a map is worth a thousand words. Most of these have taken the form of a choropleth map. Here, we propose employing cartograms to visualise both the expansion and spread of COVID-19. We designed a combination of six circular cartograms containing the data of confirmed cases every 48 hours from 24 January to 3 February 2020. Such a design conveys both spatial and temporal information more intuitively and efficiently, so it can be expected to facilitate better public participation in the fight against COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Map makers have for many years searched for a way to construct cartograms, maps in which the sizes of geographic regions such as countries or provinces appear in proportion to their population or some other analogous property. Such maps are invaluable for the representation of census results, election returns, disease incidence, and many other kinds of human data. Unfortunately, to scale regions and still have them fit together, one is normally forced to distort the regions' shapes, potentially resulting in maps that are difficult to read. Many methods for making cartograms have been proposed, some of them are extremely complex, but all suffer either from this lack of readability or from other pathologies, like overlapping regions or strong dependence on the choice of coordinate axes. Here, we present a technique based on ideas borrowed from elementary physics that suffers none of these drawbacks. Our method is conceptually simple and produces useful, elegant, and easily readable maps. We illustrate the method with applications to the results of the 2000 U.S. presidential election, lung cancer cases in the State of New York, and the geographical distribution of stories appearing in the news.},

A cartogram, or a value-by-area map, is a representation of a map in which geographic regions are modified to reflect a given statistic, such as population or income. Of the many different types of cartograms, the contiguous and Dorling types are among the most popular and most effective. With this in mind, we evaluate the memorability of these two cartogram types with a human-subjects study, using task-based experimental data and cartogram visualization tasks based on Bertin's map reading levels. In particular, our results indicate that Dorling cartograms are associated with better recall of general patterns and trends. This, together with additional significant differences between the two most popular cartogram types, has implications for the design and use of cartograms, in the context of memorability.},

  abstract = {When representing 2D data points with spacious objects such as labels, overlap can occur. We present a simple algorithm which modifies the (Mani-)Wordle idea with scan-line based techniques to allow a better placement. We give an introduction to common placement techniques from different fields and compare our method to these techniques w.r.t. euclidean displacement, changes in orthogonal ordering as well as shape and size preservation. Especially in dense scenarios our method preserves the overall shape better than known techniques and allows a good trade-off between the other measures. Applications on real world data are given and discussed.},

  abstract = {Cartogram is a technique for visualisation of the geographical distribution of spatial data. It has two main types, i.e. distance cartogram and area cartogram. Area cartogram is a transformed map in which areas are resized in proportion to an attribute value. A number of techniques have been developed for the generation of area cartograms. Some researchers consider cartogram as a very effective technique for visualisation of spatial data, while others doubt about the effectiveness because of the possible distortion in shape and/or disconnectivity in topology. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of area cartogram for visualizing spatial data. In this study, two comparative experiments have been conducted. One is the comparison between thematic maps and cartograms, and the other is the comparison among different types of area cartogram. Two sets of data with different characteristics are used, i.e. 2005 China population data and 1996 US election data. Results show that cartogram is more effective in the representation of the 1996 US election data which provides a qualitative result (i.e. in binary form or nominal data), but thematic map is far more effective in the representation of 2005 China population data which provides a quantitative result (in classes or ordinal data). It is also found that among different types of area cartogram, pseudo-cartogram is the most preferred technique and Dorling cartogram is the least preferred one.},

  abstract = {Cartograms are a popular and useful technique for depicting geo-spatial data. Dorling style and rectangular cartograms are very good for facilitating comparisons between unit areas. Each unit area is represented by the same shape such as a circle or rectangle, and the uniformity in shapes facilitates comparative judgment. However, the layout of these more abstract shapes may also simultaneously reduce the map's legibility and increase error. When we integrate univariate data into a cartogram, the recognizability of cartogram may be reduced. There is a trade-off between information recognition and geo-information accuracy. This is the inspiration behind the work we present. We attempt to increase the map's recognizability and reduce error by introducing topological features into the cartographic map. Our goal is to include topological features such as a river in a Dorling-style or rectangular cartogram to make the visual layout more recognizable, increase map cognition and reduce geospatial error. We believe that compared to the standard Dorling and rectangular style cartogram, adding topological features provides familiar geo-spatial cues and flexibility to enhance the recognizability of a cartogram.},
