\section{Introduction and Motivation}

\new{Cartograms are representations of geographical space generated by the value-by-area mapping technique that combines statistical and geographical information. Various styles of cartograms have been proposed and implemented in fields such as geography, social science, and visualization \cite{dent2009Cartography}.} 

\new{In this paper, we follow the categorization of cartograms by \citea{nusrat2016State}: contiguous, non-contiguous, rectangular, and Dorling. Among these four types, trade-offs between accuracies are made (See \tableref{table:accuracy}).}

\new{
    Based on Demers cartograms, we include dynamic topological features, such as rivers and mountains, aiming to improve the topological accuracy without sacrificing statistical accuracy. We then introduce a cartographic layout algorithm that uses these topological features to update the layout of the nodes representing geographical regions. To minimize cartographic errors, the algorithm also updates the position of rivers to accommodate the node layout. We then visualize a real world Electronic Health Records (EHR) dataset to assess the accuracy of our algorithm.
